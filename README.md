1) How do I approach designing software?
  - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
         The design skills I have learned has helped me to take a 2D image and turn it into a 3D scene, that the user can move around in to see every angle of the design.  I have learned to create a 3D scene using textures, color, shapes, and lighting.    
  - What design process did you follow for your project work?
         The process I followed to create my project was to start from the outside and work my way in.  By first starting with a room to place my scene in, it helped me to determine how I would size the objects and place them within the scene.  After the room was created I created the desk, plant, light, desktop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and lastly the mouse pad.
    Once I created the lamp I also worked on the first lighting placement, and after I created the monitor and desktop I added the other two.  As each item was created I would add a pattern and texture, so that I would not have to jump back and forth throughout the project on each object.  I would have each object mostly finished, and once all lighting was added
    I could add final touches to the textures on each object.  
  - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
         Tactics I used could be applied in future work on anything I need to create.  Create an order of importance and work your way through each.  Once the majority is done, I can go back and fine tune near the end.  This approach will keep me on track and organized.    


2) How do I approach developing programs?
  - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
         New developing strategies I have learned while working on this 3D scene are, better ways to organize my code.  I have always known to use comments to explain and organize the code.  But organizing it in the process in which I developed it, also helped me to go back and find each object I needed to work on.  
  - How did iteration factor into your development?
         Iteration factored into my development by allowing me to create the scene in steps and allowing me to go back and fine tune things along the way and near the end.  Iterations allowed me to stay organized and accomplish tasks before starting a new one.  
  - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
         My appraoch to developing the code evolved throughout the milestones, which led to my project's completion by keeping me more organized, so that I accomplish milestones on time.  This also prevented me from getting overwhelemed because I seperated the project into segments, rather than focus on it as a whole.  


3) How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
         Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway because it gives me experience working through a project, using organization and time management.  These skills can be used in every class I will take in the future.    
  - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
         Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional pathway because it provides me more skills, so that I have more paths to choose from when determing my future career.  It also provides me with skills that help me work through a project and accomplish it on time and efficiently.
